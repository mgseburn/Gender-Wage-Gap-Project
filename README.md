## Project Description
[See Our Project](https://gender-wage-gap-project-ix5kzelgmbsrcprxahtcqw.streamlit.app/)
### Queestions of interest
 -Why isn't progress being made to narrow this pay gap?
 -How can we use data to visualize these trends?
 -What are the trends within these gaps?

### Importance statement
These questions are *especially* **important** because...
1. Economic inequalities and gender wage gaps still pose a significant barrier towards narrowing economic gaps and fostering equality in the workplace. These disparities remain a significant challenge in our society and they need to be prioritized so policymakers can efficiently rectify them to promote equity in our economy.
   It is Currently Relevant  in the News;
3.  Despite all efforts to overcome these inequalities, significant gaps still exist. This persistent gap is still prevalent across our global society. In 2022, American women earned approximately 82 cents for every $1 an American man earns which dropped from 2019 where it was 92 cents per dollar ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/us/equal-pay-day-explainer.html). )
4.  Looking at the bigger picture, women in the United States lose a combined total of 1.6 trillion dollars per year because of the wage gap. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/18/the-wage-gap-costs-women-1point6-trillion-a-year-report-finds.html#:~:text=The%20wage%20gap%20costs%20women%20%241.6%20trillion%20a%20year%2C%20new,get%20the%20pay%20you%20deserve&text=The%20wage%20gap%20costs%20women%20in%20the%20U.S.%20about%20%241.6,Partnership%20for%20Women%20and%20Families.).) Due to this, families, businesses and the economy suffer as a result.
5.  Looking even further into the future, it is predicted to take 257 years to close the gender gap if we continue to move at the current rate of change ([ET Edge Insights](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/12/global-economic-gender-pay-gap-equality-women-parity-pay/)).

## Data Description
We got our data from the US Bureau of Labour statistics which had us specifically look at earnings. To be able to use this with looking at the gender gap we needed to focus on different demographics to see how various factors affect it. The data set that we chose to use was the comprehensive earnings for men and women including characteristics such as age, education, location and ect. We created 3 smaller excel sheets that are simpler to work with because it just includes our focuses.
3 Main Focuses;
- Females percentage of earnings to Males across various age groups over a long period of time
- Females Median Weekly Earnings proportional to Males from 2022 for each state
- Education levels of Females and Males over a long period of time along with their median earnings
The columns that we specifically interacted with are the different states to be compared with the male median weekly earnings and the female weekly earning which is a dollar amount. Then years from 1979 to 2022 to show the change in median weekly earnings by gender for male and female in different categories of by age as well as different education levels. 
   

## Interpreting Visualizations
**Figure 1: Yearly Percentage for Different Age Ranges**

**Description:** Using the Time Series Graph, we used the women's earnings as a percentage of menâ€™s salaries. We examined the Median usual weekly earnings of wage and salary workers, by hours usually worked. This comparison represented a significant disparity: males consistently exhibit higher earnings per hour compared to females. In addition, in the later age groups, mostly ages 35-65 show even bigger disparities. This is showing that later in life, towards the end of people's careers men are being paid drastically more because in 2022 the 55-64 year old range females are making 70% of what the average male is making which is still a lot of money lost each year. This can be due to the earlier age groups working lower income jobs that have a very standard pay range and leave little room for disparities, for example, minimum wage fast food jobs they are the closest ones to being at 100% of what males make as they are closest to the baseline of being equivalent.

**Description:** This heat map of the United States shows a snapshot of how the gender gap recently is across different states. This used a proportion of Females Median Weekly Earnings compared to Males from 2022 for each state. The darker purple the state is means the larger the gap is in that state and Nevada and New Hampshire are 75%. Whereas the more yellow the state gets the closer to being equivalent to males salary it is so Rhode Island has the best with 99%. This is important to pay attention to and to reevaluate so states can see how they are doing compared to each other so they can identify why the gap is different and so they can improve from themselves each year.

**Description:** This time series visualization is very insightful because it shows how even with the same level of education the gap in median weekly earnings is still present and relevant. Looking at the highest degree with a Bachelor degree or higher the gap between male and female is the largest and it follows a similar trend in growth over the years but the gap does not seem to close overtime. Showing that they have been higher valued over time and worth more to companies. And closer to the 1980s females with Bachelor degrees and above were still making less than males with just associate degrees and even highschool degrees. But by the 1990s females with bachelors surpassed them which shows a little progress. It is interesting to see that females with associate degrees are actually making more than males with that degree. But the lowest earnings are females without a highschool diploma and that is shown historically over time. However it is clear that females overall need to be paid a lot more because even with the same levels of education as many males they are still and have been underpaid.

## Discussion & Summary
**Discussion:**
What does AI have to say about this topic and how to improve it?
- "The gender pay gap persists for several reasons, including discrimination, occupational segregation, unconscious biases, and differences in negotiation skills. Efforts to narrow the pay gap include promoting pay transparency, implementing equal pay legislation, encouraging diversity and inclusion initiatives in workplaces, and providing training on unconscious bias and negotiation skills"
- it also recommended to use line charts, bar charts, box plots, scatter plots, or heatmaps
- then it addressed why visualizations are super important; "By analyzing these trends using data visualization techniques, stakeholders can better understand the factors contributing to the gender pay gap and develop targeted interventions to address them."

**Key Takeaways:**
3 Main Focuses;
- Females percentage of earnings to Males across various age groups over a long period of time
- Females Median Weekly Earnings proportional  to Males from 2022 for each state
- Education levels of Females and Males over a long period of time along with their median earnings
By working towards closing the gender wage gap, we need to see more progress in  societal and cultural norms. By leveraging data and visualizations we can better understand the underlying factors that create these gaps and help spread awareness and encourage creating strategies to improve it.
