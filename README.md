### Queestions of interest
-Why isn't progress being made to narrow this pay gap?
-How can we use data to visualize these trends?
-What are the trends within these gaps?

### Importance statement
These questions are *especially* **important** because...
1. Economic inequalities and gender wage gaps still pose a significant barrier towards narrowing economic gaps and fostering equality in the workplace. These disparities remain a significant challenge in our society and they need to be prioritized so policymakers can efficiently rectify them to promote equity in our economy.
