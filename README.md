## Project Description
[See Our Project](https://gender-wage-gap-project-ix5kzelgmbsrcprxahtcqw.streamlit.app/)
### Queestions of interest
 -Why isn't progress being made to narrow this pay gap?
 -How can we use data to visualize these trends?
 -What are the trends within these gaps?

### Importance statement
These questions are *especially* **important** because...
1. Economic inequalities and gender wage gaps still pose a significant barrier towards narrowing economic gaps and fostering equality in the workplace. These disparities remain a significant challenge in our society and they need to be prioritized so policymakers can efficiently rectify them to promote equity in our economy.
2.  Despite all efforts to overcome these inequalities, significant gaps still exist. This persistent gap is still prevalent across our global society. In 2022, American women earned approximately 82 cents for every $1 an American man earns which dropped from 2019 where it was 92 cents per dollar ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/us/equal-pay-day-explainer.html). )
3.  Looking at the bigger picture, women in the United States lose a combined total of 1.6 trillion dollars per year because of the wage gap. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/18/the-wage-gap-costs-women-1point6-trillion-a-year-report-finds.html#:~:text=The%20wage%20gap%20costs%20women%20%241.6%20trillion%20a%20year%2C%20new,get%20the%20pay%20you%20deserve&text=The%20wage%20gap%20costs%20women%20in%20the%20U.S.%20about%20%241.6,Partnership%20for%20Women%20and%20Families.).) Due to this, families, businesses and the economy suffer as a result.
4.  Looking even further into the future, it is predicted to take 257 years to close the gender gap if we continue to move at the current rate of change ([ET Edge Insights](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/12/global-economic-gender-pay-gap-equality-women-parity-pay/)).

## Data Instructions 
1. Download the excel files; Map, Education, and Womens Earnings as a Percentage
2. Download the Py file and move all downloads into your working directory
3. Click the link above that says "See Our Project" to interact with our results
## Data Description
We got our data from the US Bureau of Labour statstics which had us specifcally look at earnings. To able to use this with looking at the gender gap we needed to focus in on different demographics to see how variour factors affect it. The data set that we chose to use was the comprehensive earnings for men and women including characteristics such as age, education, location and ect. We created 3 smaller excel sheets that are simplier to work with because it just includes our focuses.
3 Main Focuses;
- Females percentage of earnings to Males across various age groups over a long period of time
- Females Median Weekly Earnings poprtional to Males from 2022 for each state
- Education levels of Females and Males over a long period of time along with their median earnings
The columns that we specifically interacted with are the different states to be compared with the male median weekly earnings and the female weekly earning which is a dollar amount. Then years from 1979 to 2022 to show the change in median weekly earnings by gender for male and female in different categories of by age as well as different education levels.

## Discussion & Summary
By working towards closing the gender wage gap, we need to see more progress in  societal and cultural norms. By leveraging data and visualizations we can better understand the underlying factors that create these gaps and help spread awareness and encourage creating strategies to improve it.
