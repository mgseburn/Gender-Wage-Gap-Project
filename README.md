## Project Description
[See Our Project](https://gender-wage-gap-project-ix5kzelgmbsrcprxahtcqw.streamlit.app/)
### Queestions of interest
-Why isn't progress being made to narrow this pay gap?
-How can we use data to visualize these trends?
-What are the trends within these gaps?

### Importance statement
These questions are *especially* **important** because...
1. Economic inequalities and gender wage gaps still pose a significant barrier towards narrowing economic gaps and fostering equality in the workplace. These disparities remain a significant challenge in our society and they need to be prioritized so policymakers can efficiently rectify them to promote equity in our economy.
2.  Despite all efforts to overcome these inequalities, significant gaps still exist. This persistent gap is still prevalent across our global society. In 2022, American women earned approximately 82 cents for every $1 an American man earns which dropped from 2019 where it was 92 cents per dollar (New York Times). 
3.  Looking at the bigger picture, women in the United States lose a combined total of 1.6 trillion dollars per year because of the wage gap. (CNBC). Due to this, families, businesses and the economy suffer as a result.
4.  Looking even further into the future, it is predicted to take 257 years to close the gender gap if we continue to move at the current rate of change (ET Edge Insights).

## Discussion & Summary
By working towards closing the gender wage gap, we need to see more progress in  societal and cultural norms. By leveraging data and visualizations we can better understand the underlying factors that create these gaps and help spread awareness and encourage creating strategies to improve it.
